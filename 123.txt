   Prompt: Create a fully optimized Minecraft modpack concept tailored for a laptop with an i5-6100 CPU and 8GB RAM. The modpack must run smoothly and be carefully optimized. Theme: Hardcore Medieval Zombie Apocalypse SMP.  Core Requirements  Medieval-themed world — no modern guns, no city apocalypse, no modern tech.  Technology must exist, but only in a primitive, tribal, medieval or early-industrial style, similar to Doctor Stone-level tech.  No solar panels, no futuristic items.  Mechanical, gear-based, windmill/watermill systems are allowed.  Magic system must be full-featured, using:  Dark magic  Classic medieval Merlin/Camelot-style magic  Zombie Behavior (very important)  Extremely intelligent AI.  Zombies must:  Break blocks  Track players using sound  Get attracted to light sources  Detect sound or light from very long distances  Spawn in massive hordes (50–100 units)  During night, visibility becomes so low that players feel almost blind.  Light sources provide very weak illumination.  Special giant zombie “brute” monsters appear:  Hidden in dark forests  Rarely spawning  Also appear during Blood Moons  Blood Moon System  Blood Moons trigger massive zombie invasions.  Hordes automatically move toward bases.  Players must defend their settlements from siege-like attacks.  World & Atmosphere  Large, open-world map.  Environment must be:  Dark, cold, harsh  Forest-heavy and frightening  No villages or normal structures.  Acceptable structure generation:  Abandoned medieval castles  Ruined strongholds  Large walls or “beyond the wall” style terrain (inspired by Game of Thrones)  Tribal SMP Gameplay  World designed for multiple tribes (groups of players).  Tribes are:  Sometimes hostile  Sometimes forced to cooperate for survival  Cooperation becomes necessary:  To trade food  To exchange primitive technology  To survive massive zombie events  To maintain warmth in extremely cold weather  Progression & Survival  Progression must be slow, difficult, and exhausting.  Technology unlock system must be multi-stage and very challenging.  Advanced tools or machines require effort, trade, or tribal cooperation.  Harsh survival mechanics:  Realistic hunger  Severe cold/heat requirement (temperature survival)  Limited resources  Combat & Equipment  Weapons must be medieval:  Swords  Spears  Shields  Bows  Siege-like defensive tools  Optional:  Mechanical turrets (primitive/gear-based only)  Defensive medieval fortifications  Overall Goal  Create a modpack concept that forces players to:  Stay inside safe bases  Fear venturing into darkness  Cooperate or fight other tribes  Survive overwhelming zombie threats  Slowly build primitive tech and medieval magic  Defend their tribe like in FALL OUT, but with a medieval setting  The final output should include:  Suggested mods  Compatibility notes  Optimization strategies for low-end hardware  Optional configuration ideas  Recommended AI, zombie, worldgen, magic and tech mods  Final structure of the modpack

   Prompt: Create a fully optimized Minecraft modpack concept tailored for a laptop with an i5-6100 CPU and 8GB RAM. The modpack must run smoothly and be carefully optimized. Theme: Hardcore Medieval Zombie Apocalypse SMP.  Core Requirements  Medieval-themed world — no modern guns, no city apocalypse, no modern tech.  Technology must exist, but only in a primitive, tribal, medieval or early-industrial style, similar to Doctor Stone-level tech.  No solar panels, no futuristic items.  Mechanical, gear-based, windmill/watermill systems are allowed.  Magic system must be full-featured, using:  Dark magic  Classic medieval Merlin/Camelot-style magic  Zombie Behavior (very important)  Extremely intelligent AI.  Zombies must:  Break blocks  Track players using sound  Get attracted to light sources  Detect sound or light from very long distances  Spawn in massive hordes (50–100 units)  During night, visibility becomes so low that players feel almost blind.  Light sources provide very weak illumination.  Special giant zombie “brute” monsters appear:  Hidden in dark forests  Rarely spawning  Also appear during Blood Moons  Blood Moon System  Blood Moons trigger massive zombie invasions.  Hordes automatically move toward bases.  Players must defend their settlements from siege-like attacks.  World & Atmosphere  Large, open-world map.  Environment must be:  Dark, cold, harsh  Forest-heavy and frightening  No villages or normal structures.  Acceptable structure generation:  Abandoned medieval castles  Ruined strongholds  Large walls or “beyond the wall” style terrain (inspired by Game of Thrones)  Tribal SMP Gameplay  World designed for multiple tribes (groups of players).  Tribes are:  Sometimes hostile  Sometimes forced to cooperate for survival  Cooperation becomes necessary:  To trade food  To exchange primitive technology  To survive massive zombie events  To maintain warmth in extremely cold weather  Progression & Survival  Progression must be slow, difficult, and exhausting.  Technology unlock system must be multi-stage and very challenging.  Advanced tools or machines require effort, trade, or tribal cooperation.  Harsh survival mechanics:  Realistic hunger  Severe cold/heat requirement (temperature survival)  Limited resources  Combat & Equipment  Weapons must be medieval:  Swords  Spears  Shields  Bows  Siege-like defensive tools  Optional:  Mechanical turrets (primitive/gear-based only)  Defensive medieval fortifications  Overall Goal  Create a modpack concept that forces players to:  Stay inside safe bases  Fear venturing into darkness  Cooperate or fight other tribes  Survive overwhelming zombie threats  Slowly build primitive tech and medieval magic  Defend their tribe like in FALL OUT, but with a medieval setting  The final output should include:  Suggested mods  Compatibility notes  Optimization strategies for low-end hardware  Optional configuration ideas  Recommended AI, zombie, worldgen, magic and tech mods  Final structure of the modpack

🚀 Starting AI Modpack Builder V3 (Architecture-First)
================================================================================
📝 User Prompt: Create a fully optimized Minecraft modpack concept tailored for a laptop with an i5-6100 CPU and 8GB RAM. The modpack must run smoothly and be carefully optimized. Theme: Hardcore Medieval Zombie Apocalypse SMP.  Core Requirements  Medieval-themed world — no modern guns, no city apocalypse, no modern tech.  Technology must exist, but only in a primitive, tribal, medieval or early-industrial style, similar to Doctor Stone-level tech.  No solar panels, no futuristic items.  Mechanical, gear-based, windmill/watermill systems are allowed.  Magic system must be full-featured, using:  Dark magic  Classic medieval Merlin/Camelot-style magic  Zombie Behavior (very important)  Extremely intelligent AI.  Zombies must:  Break blocks  Track players using sound  Get attracted to light sources  Detect sound or light from very long distances  Spawn in massive hordes (50–100 units)  During night, visibility becomes so low that players feel almost blind.  Light sources provide very weak illumination.  Special giant zombie “brute” monsters appear:  Hidden in dark forests  Rarely spawning  Also appear during Blood Moons  Blood Moon System  Blood Moons trigger massive zombie invasions.  Hordes automatically move toward bases.  Players must defend their settlements from siege-like attacks.  World & Atmosphere  Large, open-world map.  Environment must be:  Dark, cold, harsh  Forest-heavy and frightening  No villages or normal structures.  Acceptable structure generation:  Abandoned medieval castles  Ruined strongholds  Large walls or “beyond the wall” style terrain (inspired by Game of Thrones)  Tribal SMP Gameplay  World designed for multiple tribes (groups of players).  Tribes are:  Sometimes hostile  Sometimes forced to cooperate for survival  Cooperation becomes necessary:  To trade food  To exchange primitive technology  To survive massive zombie events  To maintain warmth in extremely cold weather  Progression & Survival  Progression must be slow, difficult, and exhausting.  Technology unlock system must be multi-stage and very challenging.  Advanced tools or machines require effort, trade, or tribal cooperation.  Harsh survival mechanics:  Realistic hunger  Severe cold/heat requirement (temperature survival)  Limited resources  Combat & Equipment  Weapons must be medieval:  Swords  Spears  Shields  Bows  Siege-like defensive tools  Optional:  Mechanical turrets (primitive/gear-based only)  Defensive medieval fortifications  Overall Goal  Create a modpack concept that forces players to:  Stay inside safe bases  Fear venturing into darkness  Cooperate or fight other tribes  Survive overwhelming zombie threats  Slowly build primitive tech and medieval magic  Defend their tribe like in FALL OUT, but with a medieval setting  The final output should include:  Suggested mods  Compatibility notes  Optimization strategies for low-end hardware  Optional configuration ideas  Recommended AI, zombie, worldgen, magic and tech mods  Final structure of the modpack
